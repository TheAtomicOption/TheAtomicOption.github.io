## this isn't a dating profile 

When I'm not working as a software engineer, or putting play projects into this cookie cutter github showcase site, I spend most of my time reading, rock climbing, playing computer games, playing basketball (poorly), lifting, or going along on whatever outdoor adventure my friends think up. I'm single and living on my own in the Portland, OR area.

## this guy is awesome, but where did he come from?

I grew up in western rural OR, playing in the woods with sticks, riding dirt bikes, skiing, and getting computer lessons from my dad who's an electrical engineer. 

BSc Information Systems (Walla Walla University)
In my first degree, I wanted some business classes and didn't want to be confined to solely programming. Degrees matter much less than I thought at they did at the time. Still, computers and short bursts of charisma are both things I'm good at, so this was a natural fit.

BSc Molecular Biology (Portland State University)
I started this second degree with the intention of getting a PhD and helping to work on therapies to repair biological aging. The debilitation and death caused by lack of this technology far exclipses all other problems in the modern world. This is a cause I still care deeply about, and see far too little effort applied to. However by the time I was finished with undergrad for the second time, it was clear both that I'm poorly suited for the tedious precision wet lab work that I'd need to do during grad school, that biological science is a field where I'm less exceptionally gifted than in computing, and that choosing an unorthodox direction for your theoretical / analytical work isn't something most modern scientists can typically afford to do until very late in their career, if ever. While I'd still like to get a PhD at some point, I feel the most effective thing I can do today is make a good salary and donate to the few who are already doing the work.
