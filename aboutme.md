title: About me
---

When I'm not working as a software engineer, or putting play projects into this cookie cutter github site, I spend most of my time reading, rock climbing, playing computer games, writing anonymous essays to explore how I think about things, playing basketball (poorly), lifting, or going along on whatever outdoor adventure my friends think up. I'm single and living on my own in the Portland, OR metro area. 

## Background that hopefully doesn't include password reset question answers

I have two B.Sci degrees, Information Systems & Molecular Biology. I've worked as a marketing analyst, biology lab technician, telemarketer, door-to-door salesman, and am currently employed as a programmer.
